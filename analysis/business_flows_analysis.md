## Core Business Flows

### Strategy Testing with Fake Account
**Trigger**: User selects a cryptocurrency and strategy on the Fake Account page
**Steps**:
1. User selects a cryptocurrency from the dropdown and clicks "SET COIN"
2. System connects to Binance WebSocket for real-time price data
3. User sees real-time price chart updating with current market data
4. User selects a strategy from the dropdown and clicks "Start Strategy"
5. Behind the scenes: System initializes the selected strategy with default parameters
6. System begins processing price data through the strategy algorithm
7. When strategy generates a buy signal, system simulates buying the cryptocurrency
8. User sees wallet value updating based on price movements
9. When strategy generates a sell signal, system simulates selling the cryptocurrency
10. Final outcome: User can evaluate strategy performance with simulated funds

**Business Rules**:
- Initial wallet value is set to 1000 (currency unspecified)
- Trading fees are simulated for realistic performance evaluation
- Only one strategy can be active at a time
- Strategy requires sufficient data points before generating signals

### Live Trading with Binance Account

  - container: Vector of OHLC data points
  - period: Number of data points to analyze
  - last_rsi: Last calculated RSI value
  - last_moving_avarage: Last calculated moving average
  - last_slope: Last calculated price trend angle
- **Relationships**: Used by strategies for decision making
- **Lifecycle**: Created when strategy is initialized, updated with new data, cleared when strategy stops

### Cryptocurrency
- **What it represents**: Digital asset being traded
- **Key attributes**:
  - Symbol (BTC, ETH, etc.)
  - Current price
  - Trading volume
- **Relationships**: Associated with orders, price data, and strategies
- **Lifecycle**: Selected by user, remains active until changed

### Trading Strategy

  - Name
  - Parameters
  - State (active/inactive)
  - Performance metrics
- **Relationships**: Uses price data, generates trading signals

## Business Rules & Logic

### Validation Rules
- API keys must be valid for Binance API access
- Strategy parameters must be within valid ranges
- Order quantities must be above minimum allowed by Binance
- Order prices must be within valid price range
- Historical data requests must be within API limits

### Calculations & Algorithms
- **Moving Average Calculation**:
  ```
  MA = sum(prices) / period
  ```
  
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index) Calculation**:
  ```
  RS = average_gain / average_loss
  RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
  ```
  
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) Calculation**:
  ```
  MACD Line = 12-period EMA - 26-period EMA
  Signal Line = 9-period EMA of MACD Line
  ```
  
- **Simple Moving Average Strategy Logic**:
  ```
  If price crosses above MA and RSI > 30:
    Generate BUY signal
  If price crosses below MA and RSI > 60:
    Generate SELL signal
  If price > purchase_price * (1 + profit_threshold):
    Generate SELL signal
  ```

### Automated Processes
- WebSocket connections automatically reconnect if dropped
- User data stream is kept alive with periodic pings
- Charts automatically update with new data
- Strategies automatically process new price
